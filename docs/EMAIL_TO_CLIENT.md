**Body (copy below into your email):**

Hi,

Please find below a short overview of the **CM360 Creative Renamer** tool — how to access it, how the screen looks, and how to use it.

**Link to the tool:** https://rename-vm3h.onrender.com  
(No login required. First visit may take 30–60 seconds to load.)

---

**What you’ll see on the page**

- **Header** with the tool name and a one-line description.
- **Two upload areas:** one for your **creatives ZIP**, one for your **T-sheet** (Excel or CSV). After you select files, their names appear below each area.
- A **slider** for “Confidence threshold” (default 70%). Matches below this are still suggested but highlighted in the preview for review.
- **Three buttons:**  
  - **Preview mapping** — see a table of each file → new name and match %.  
  - **Download renamed ZIP** — get the ZIP with all creatives renamed to the CM360 names (extensions like .jpg are kept).  
  - **Download CSV log** — get a log (Original name, New name, Match %) for your records.
- After you click **Preview mapping**, a **table** appears showing every file, its new name, and match %. Rows below your threshold are highlighted so you can quickly spot items to review.

**How to use it (in short)**

1. Open the link and wait for the page to load.  
2. Upload your **creatives ZIP** and your **T-sheet** (Excel/CSV).  
3. (Optional) Adjust the confidence threshold with the slider.  
4. Click **Preview mapping** to review the suggested renames.  
5. Click **Download renamed ZIP** and/or **Download CSV log** when you’re ready.

The tool automatically finds the CM360 creative name column in your sheet where possible. You can run it as many times as you need for different packs or sheets.

**What you get**

- A **ZIP** with the same creatives, renamed to the exact CM360 names from your T-sheet, ready for upload to CM360.  
- An optional **CSV log** (Original name, New name, Match %) for audit and review.
